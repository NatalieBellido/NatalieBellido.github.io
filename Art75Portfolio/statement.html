  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>The topics I explore in my art relate to who I am, my interests, feelings, and beliefs. The intentions behind work are to convey these things things about me to my audience and to send a message about the topic I address. The subjects I choose to explore are usually personal and in some way relate to my life. When delivering these ideas, I usually try to be honest and straightforward. Since I'm new to using a lot of the mediums I'm working with, it takes me a lot of time and effort to make my work come to life. Most of the time, I'm not satisfied with the way my work turns out, but I believe that feeling like that motivates me to keep trying to improve. Going forward, I hope that I am able to keep learning and practicing new ways to express myself through my work.</p>
