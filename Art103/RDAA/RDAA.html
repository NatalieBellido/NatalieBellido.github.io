      <h6><em>Part 1: Recontextualized Diagrams</em></h6>
      <p>For this assignment, we were asked to look at 3 of our previous diagrams and use all 13 system concepts to explain the diagrams.</p>

    <p>The first diagram I chose to talk about was the second diagram from my previous assignment. This diagram was the one that had to show a process of something. In this case, this is the process of fixing an error.</p>

    <p>The second diagram I chose to explain was the third diagram from my previous assignment. This diagram was the one that had to be something considered living. In this case, this is blood circulation. It is something that living things have.</p>

    <p>The third diagram I decided to use was the fifth diagram from my previous assignment. For that diagram, we were asked to find said that it must be a system based on modularity. This is a diagram I found about modularity and networking. I felt that this fit the description since it is showing something that can be separated and recombined.</p>

      <h6><em>Part 2: Art and Artist</em></h6>
      <p>For this assignment, we were asked to chose an artist we admire and one of their pieces. Then we were asked to make diagrams to explain the artpiece and the artist's artisic process.</p>

    <p>Ross Tran, also known as RossDraws, is a digital artist that makes drawings of famous characters using Photoshop. I first found out about him (around year or two ago) through a Youtube video recommendation about his Sombra drawing. I thought it looked really cool in the thumbnail and decided to watch the video. I ended up liking his art after that. For this diagram, I answered the question of if his piece was really art using simple questions of what I think art is and isn't. I think this isn't a great system to figure out what art is since it depends on the person looking at it, but I would consider this drawing art since he put time and effort into it, went through a few changes, wasn't traced or recolored of someone else's work, was inspired by a video game character, and makes the viewer (in this case, me) feel something.</p>

    <p>I don't know all the details of Ross's process, but I can tell from his videos that he has many things already thought out before he begins drawing. He normally already has the sketch done in Photoshop when he begins his videos and he always knows what colors he is going to use. This makes me believe that these are steps he takes before starting the video. The videos always follow the pattern of him explaining what he'll draw, a short sped up clip of him working on the drawing, the color dodge event, and the finished piece. I made a diagram that has these steps in the order I think they would normally happen if he weren't making a video, but simplified the steps as well so that the diagram could possibly be appled to other artists.</p>
