      <h6><em>Part 1: System Diagrams</em></h6>
      <p>For this assignment, we were asked to look for 5 diagrams. One diagram must have more than 100 elements. One diagram must show a process of some kind. One diagram must be something considered living. One diagram must be represent something that is not visible or physical. One diagram must be a system based on modularity.</p>

    <h6><em>Diagram 1</em></h6>
    <p>The first diagram we were asked to find said that it must have more than 100 elements. This is an image of the life of stars. I felt that it fit this description since there are several stars in our universe.</p>

<img src="images/Diagram2.png" alt="Diagram 2">
    <h6><em>Diagram 2</em></h6>
    <p>The second diagram we were asked to find said that it must show a process of some kind. This is a debugging by deduction diagram that I felt that it fit this description since it shows the process of testing and retrying something to get it right.</p>

              <div class="portfolio-item">
<img src="images/Diagram3.png" alt="Diagram 3">
    <h6><em>Diagram 3</em></h6>
    <p>The third diagram we were asked to find said that it must be something considered living. This is a diagram of blood circulation that I felt that it fit this description since this is a system of an important part of living.</p>

              <div class="portfolio-item">
<img src="images/Diagram4.png" alt="Diagram 4">
    <h6><em>Diagram 4</em></h6>
    <p>The fourth diagram we were asked to find said that it must represent something that is not visible or physical. This is a diagram I found that explains the different types of love. I felt that it fit this description since love is a feeling and isn't something that you can see or touch.</p>

              <div class="portfolio-item">
<img src="images/Diagram5.png" alt="Diagram 5">
    <h6><em>Diagram 5</em></h6>
    <p>The fifth diagram we were asked to find said that it must be a system based on modularity. This is a diagram I found about modularity and networking. I felt that this fit the description since it is showing something that can be separated and recombined.</p>
