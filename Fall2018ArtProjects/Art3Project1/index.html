<h1>Like Butterflies</h1>

<p>This project was done in several parts. The art (the background and people walking) was done in Krita and the butterfly photo was edited in Photoshop. Then all of it was put together in Atom using Javascript to help it move and change colors. My message was to bring light to the situation at the border with the immigrants coming from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. They are making the journey from Central America to help their family have a better future and putting their lives at risk to get to the United States.</p> <a href="https://nataliebellido.github.io/Fall2018ArtProjects/Art3Project1/sketch.js"> Show Code
