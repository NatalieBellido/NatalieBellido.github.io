      <h3><em>Better Future</em>, image, 2017</h3>
      <p>It was my first time using Photoshop and exploring it's features. I was playing around with what I could do with an image I took of a location near my house. By Photoshopping animals and more greenery into the photo, I created a representation of my idea of a better future. Instead of the dark and gloomy vacant areas, we'll allow nature to have those spaces and transform them into beautiful views.</p>

      <h3><em>Like a Fish out of Water</em>, video, 2018</h3>
      <p>I was exploring using visual representation, metaphors, and video effects in order to tell a story. This video is about my mother speaking about her experience coming from Mexico and immigrating to the United States. I used footage of me getting a fish from the pet store and bringing it home to symbolize my mother leaving her original country and going to a new country.</p>
