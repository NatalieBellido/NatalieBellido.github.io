      <h3><em>Better Future</em>, 2017</h3>
      <p>It was my first time using Photoshop and exploring it's features. I was playing around with what I could do with an image I took of a location near my house. By Photoshopping animals and more greenery into the photo, I created a representation of
        my idea of a better future. Instead of the dark and gloomy vacant areas, we'll allow nature to have those spaces and transform them into beautiful views.</p>

    <h3><em>Brandon</em>, 2017</h3>
    <p>My friend, Brandon, had a birthday coming up and it was around Halloween. I wanted to make him something so I decided to paint something for him. He always wears black outfits and he tends to spend a lot of time alone so I felt that a crow would be the perfect symbol for him. The lone crow in this painting is as mysterious as he is and the night sky represents his tendency of staying up late.</p>

      <h3><em>Better Future</em>, 2017</h3>
      <p>This piece was made using ink and water on drawing paper. In it is a creature from a video game and a cat. I wanted to make something representing my interests and the way I can relate things I see in real life to things I see in the video games I play. The example here is how cats remind me of a feline creature named Litten from Pokemon.</p>

    <h3><em>Like a Fish out of Water</em>, 2018</h3>
    <p>I was exploring using visual representation, metaphors, and video effects in order to tell a story. This video is about my mother speaking about her experience coming from Mexico and immigrating to the United States. I used footage of me getting a
      fish from the pet store and bringing it home to symbolize my mother leaving her original country and going to a new country.</p>

    <h3><em>As Time Passes, so Do Interests</em>, 2018</h3>
    <p>Using Javascript, I was able to create this small piece of web art. My idea behind this was to show the way interest from childhood may change as time passes. When I was really young, my sister and I loved Pokemon. Over the years, her interest in
      the anime and games seemed to deminish, but mine stayed. This piece reflects this story the moment the mouse is clicked and held.</p>

    <h3><em>Take a Break from the Screen</em>, 2018</h3>
    <p>My messange in making this video is that our daily lives are filled with technology and the internet. I believe that those things are great, but that it's important to step away from them. It is also a challenge to viewers asking them to refrain from using their devices as much as they usually do.</p>

    <h3><em>Mirror Thoughts</em>, 2017</h3>
    <p>Instead of looking into the mirror to find your flaws, this mirror refuses to allow you to pick on yourself by offering words of advice. I wanted to show that a person's worth isn't determined by physical appearance, but who they are on the inside.</p>

    <h3><em>Put Yourself in my Shoes</em>, 2018</h3>
    <p>My intent behind making this video is to respond to all the toxic behavior in a game called Overwatch and to explain the way I've been feeling after my time playing this game.</p>
