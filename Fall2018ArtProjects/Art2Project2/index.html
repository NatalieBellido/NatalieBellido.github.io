<h1>The Impossible Floor</h1>

<p>In this project, I decided to recreate a memory because it was one of the first things I imagine when asked about a map I could get lost in. I used to get lost in Pokemon Mystery Dungeon very often and this is a random map I created that resembles maps found in the game. It's not possible to escape from this map, though. The room where the stairs are located isn't accessible. This is why I named it the way I did.</p> <a href="sketch.js">Show Code</a>
