      <h6><em>Better Future</em>, 2017</h6>
      <p>This was a project I did in Art 74. It was my first time using Photoshop and exploring it's features. I was playing around with what I could do with an image I took of a location near my house. By Photoshopping animals and more greenery into the photo, I created a representation of
        my idea of a better future. Instead of the dark and gloomy vacant areas, we'll allow nature to have those spaces and transform them into beautiful views.</p>

    <h6><em>Like a Fish out of Water</em>, 2018</h6>
    <p>This video was made for Art 75. I was exploring using visual representation, metaphors, and video effects in order to tell a story. This video is about my mother speaking about her experience coming from Mexico and immigrating to the United States. I used footage of me getting a
      fish from the pet store and bringing it home to symbolize my mother leaving her original country and going to a new country.</p>

    <h6><em>Sketch 5</em>, 2018</h6>
    <p>I decided to do something space themed for this Art 101 assignment. I was taking an Astronomy class and it was the class I had before Art 101, so I had space on my mind when deciding what to do for the sketch. I ended up having the sketch make it look like someone is traveling through space and heading straight towards the sun. The white dots do something strange towards the end, but I'm happy with it overall.</p>

  <div class="portfolio-item">
    <img src="images/student_life.jpg" alt="Student Life">
    <h6><em>Student Life</em>, 2018</h6>
    <p>This one was done outside of school on my own. This image is a metaphor of how it feels to be a student. I made it using photoshop when I was feeling overwhelmed with everything I had to do. It was a nice way to express my emotions and how it feels like for me as a student. Like it's shown in the image, sometimes it just feels like I'm going to get lost in the piles of school work, projects, essays, tests, and books.</p>

  <div class="portfolio-item">
    <img src="images/not_alone.jpg" alt="Not Alone">
    <h6><em>Not Alone</em>, 2018</h6>
    <p>Instead of looking into the mirror to find your flaws, this mirror reminds the person looking into it that they aren't alone when they are feeling down. I made this piece after a talk I had with a friend who suffers from depression. I wanted to make something she could look at whenever I was unable to talk to her about how she was feeling. The message is to remind her that she isn't alone in how she feels and how there are people she can go to for support.</p>
