     <h5><em>My Worse Impulse</em>, 2019</h5>
<p> Our group chose to do the 'give way to your worst impulse' strategy. My worst impulse is to look at my phone so I chose to count how many times I did that over two days. Each time I picked up my phone, I made a note for why I did it and would edit the number for each time. At the end of the second day, I decided to make something to represent the results of this little experiment. This resulted in me drawing a phone with icons and numbers over them. The icons represent the reason I checked my phone and the numbers are how many times. </p>
 <p> I think that my piece turned out good, but I do wish I could have done more with it since it looks so simple. At first I thought about putting the icons on the canvas for the amount of times, but it seemed to be too much work so in the end I decided to simplify it. My project was made in a free drawing program called Krita and I used the shape and drawing tools to create it.</p>
